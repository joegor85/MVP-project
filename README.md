# MVP-project

This is a project to practice creating a full-stack application.

I decided to create a Tracker for you to keep track of family members' information such as birthdays, hobbies, and other things. You can assign three different hobbies to each person. You can also use it to track close friends as well, the sky is the limit!

Once a member is created in the database, you can click their name at the top and display their information in the Profile section. There is also a section below that lists out any material or space requirements that their hobbies might require. So if you're going on vacation or visiting some relatives, you can know what kinds of things to plan on bringing with you or prepare for when you get there.

In the Creating/Updating section you can fill in the fields to add a person. Be sure to include three hobby codes (there is a key at the bottom to determine hobby codes), a name, and a birthday at minimum.

You can also, dare I say, delete a person from your list.

And there is an update member section as well. If you type in the person's id number, it will pre-populate the fields with all of their information. Once you've made your changes, simply click the "Update this Person" button to update. Then click on their name at the top to be sure the changes were made.

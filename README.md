# MVP-project

This is a project to practice creating a full-stack application.

My idea is to create an application centered around quickly clicking on a family member and viewing their details and also displaying details about things that their hobbies require.

You can also do full CRUD operations (create, read, update, and delete) to family members so that you can add and remove family members as necessary.
